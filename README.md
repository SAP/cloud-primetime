# PrimeTime

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP/cloud-primetime)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP/cloud-primetime)

## Introduction
PrimeTime is a digital signage solution. It helps you to easily manage contents for screens of all types - supporting many different formats, custom templates as well as public and secured content where a prior login is required. It also acts as a technical showcase of how SAP Cloud Platform can be utilized.

## Download and installation

### Running the application locally
  - Check out and import the project as new Maven project into Eclipse
  - Create a new local "SAP/Java Web Tomcat 8 Server" in Eclipse, pointing to the downloaded Neo SDK (for additional help use [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-java-eclipse-setup.html))
  - Add the `web-neo` module to the server you just created
  - Set the module root to "/" (double-click on server, then go to modules)
  - Create a user with roles "admin" and "dbadmin" in the server with any Id, name, mail, and password (double-click on server, then go to users)
  - Optional: create a destination "featureflags" and point it to valid [Cloud Foundry feature flags service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/2250efa12769480299a1acd282b615cf/Cloud/en-US/29788680118a41cb85b6bb691507f821.html) key (double-click on server, then go to connectivity)
  - Optional: click "Create Sample Data" in the app header after the app [is started](http://localhost:8080) to get sample data created

### Building & Deploying the application
A Maven build of the application generates one war file per environment and additional optional artifacts for different UI deployment scenarios. These are described in a [separate document](/DEPLOYING.md).

## Configuration
There are multiple configuration options available which are applied in a pre-defined order. If a property value is found in a later stage, it will overwrite the previous ones.

1. base properties file (shipped with the repository, see app.properties)
2. custom properties file (created by you, e.g. app.2.properties)
3. system variable
4. environment variable (set at deploy time)
5. database (set at runtime) 

The easiest way to configure PrimeTime is at runtime through the "Configuration" tab, which requires the "admin" role. Any changes you make there will be persisted in the database.

There is also an API available which is described through a [Swagger UI](https://primetime.eu2.hana.ondemand.com/s/api/api-docs?url=/s/api/swagger.json#/default).

## Limitations
  - The [SapMachine OpenJDK](https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/) is currently not supported. There will be an error in one unit test and the server adapter will not start.
  - Deployment to cloud platforms other than SAP Cloud Platform is not supported.
  - The document service is not yet available in the Cloud Foundry environment and file support is deactivated when deploying there.

## Known Issues
None
